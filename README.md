# HSE Project: C calculator

## First and foremost
Make the simplest version of calculator, that is able to work with such expressions: 23-16+45*2.
In other words, make the job for our "3" grade.

Read the input lines and output the answers for the expressions using reversed polish notation.

Seems to be done!

## Second and secondmost
Calculate the expression, using obtained PRN (Polish Reverse Notation).
P.S.: not the hardest part of our job
