# HSE Project: C calculator

## First and foremost
Make the simplest version of calculator, that is able to work with such expressions: 23-16+45*2.
In other words, make the job for our "3" grade.

Read the input lines and output the answers for the expressions using reversed polish notation.

âœ… Seems to be done!

## Second and secondmost
Calculate the expression, using obtained PRN (Polish Reverse Notation).
P.S.: not the hardest part of our job

âœ… Seems to be done!

## Third and thirdmost
1. Parse variables from expressions, 
2. Add them to the queue (just like string, e.g. "len"),
3. Get the values for the original expression (len = 5.4),
4. Replace names of variables in queue with their values,
5. Calculate the expressionm using obtained PRN (just like in "Second and secondmost")

ðŸŸ¨ Seems to be in progress...
